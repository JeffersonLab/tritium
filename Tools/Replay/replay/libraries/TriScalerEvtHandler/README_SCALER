This is how to compile and run the scaler event handler
using the SDK.

I'm not sure but you might need to rename the class since
it's already in the Podd library.  At least try printing a
few things from the class to make sure the software is using
your version.  Also, in order to make it work with the Makefile
example from the SDK (software development kit) I had to 
rename *.C to be *.cxx

Need these files:

   THaScalerEvtHandler.h
   THaScalerEvtHandler.cxx
   Scaler_LinkDef.h
   MakeScalerHandler

To compile :

   make

To run:

  Put libscaler.so where it can be loaded, then in the analysis
  script do this:

    gSystem->Load("libScaler.so");

    THaScalerEvtHandler *lscaler = new THaScalerEvtHandler("Left","HA scaler event type 140");

    gHaEvtHandlers->Add (lscaler);
