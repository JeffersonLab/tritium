## -- created on 11/08/2016 by Zhihong Ye

### Note:
 This repository contains some tools to estimate the event rates for different Tritium experiments.
 
### Short-Range Correlations (SRCs, E12-11-112)
 - The tool to calculate the SRC rates is call "RateCal.C", which uses XEMC as the QE cross section model 
 
### MARATHON (E12-010-103)
 - The tool to calculate the MARATHON rates is call "RateCal.C", which uses several DIS models, but mainly use F2AllM and F1F209
