 This is a C++ version of SAMC which orginally developed by A. Deur in FORTRAN,
and Huan Yao converted into C++. I personally did some small modification and added a generator. The
package is released "AS IT IS" and we (especially A. Deur and H. Yao) don't hold any responsibility 
for updating the code, removing bugs, etc. Make sure you know the code well and feel free to do any 
modifications. 

 It is a well-organized package and you can use it by only changing the input file, where all parameters
related to the experimental setup is defined (e.g., c12_input.dat). The generated events are stored in 
a ROOT file. The event seeds can be uniformly generated in the code, or can be specified outside the code 
using a generator in ./Generator if you have special request.
  
 The HRS transportation functions were generated using SNACK by J. LeRose and they are coded in the 
FORTRAN subroutines. "libg2c.so" is required to sucessuflly compile this package.

The QFS cross section model is coded in this package. Another cross section model, XEMC, is also available
but pleae contact with me if you really want to use it. Of cause you can add your own physics in the code 
easily.
