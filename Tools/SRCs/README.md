# x>1 He3/H3 SRC: Model and Rate Calculators
## --created on 11/10/2016 by Zhihong Ye

## Quasi-Elastic Cross Section Model 
The model to calculate the QE cross section is called "XEMC" which can be found at two sources:
 - My webpage: www.jlab.org/~yez/XEMC (a fixed version, maybe outdated)
 - My GitHub Repository: git@github.com:yezhihong/XEMC.git  (this one is being updated continousely)

## Rate Calculator
 Use "RateCal.C" to calculate the rate. No HRS acceptance model is added but only with the tight acceptance cut.
